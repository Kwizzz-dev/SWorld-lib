# SWorld-lib
Basic world management compiled into a util!

# Wait what?
SWorld-lib is a utility API used to manage worlds in a simple way, this often helps users compact tens of lines of code to just one!

# So how do I use it?
If you plan on forking this project, then you certainly know how to pull from the github repository, however, if you're simply planning on using SWorld-lib as an addition to your plugin, head over to the Spigot resource page () and dowload the .JAR file. You'll then need to add the .JAR as an external library, for IntelliJ this can be done by pressing CTRL+Shift+ALT+S, directing to Modules, then to Dependencies - from there you'll need to click the plus sign and click "JARs or directories". This will open a file navigation window; navigate to where you saved the SWorld-lib file and you're done!
You can create a simple instance of SWorld-lib to start managing your worlds!
```java
SWorldLib lib = new SWorldLib("my-new-world");
```

# Great, what else is there?
Head over to the WIKI for more information on the methods built into this API!
